# Searhing in array
    While in need to search for element in array of distinct elements - multiple times, 
    try putting the array in Map<value, position> and do map.get(value) to reduce 
    the search run time.

# XOR-ing an Array
    if one element is present odd number of times - OK
    if multiple elements are present odd number of times - NOT OK
